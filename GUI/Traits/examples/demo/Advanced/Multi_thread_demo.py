"""
This demo shows a simple user interface being updated by multiple threads.

When the <b>Start Threads</b> button is pressed, the program starts three
independent threads running. Each thread counts from 0 to 199, updating its
own thread-specific trait, and performs a sleep of a thread-specific duration
between each update.

The <b>Start Threads</b> button is disabled while the threads are running, and
becomes active again once all threads have finished running.
