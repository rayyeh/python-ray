"""
This demo shows a simple user interface being updated by a dynamic number of
threads.

When the <b>Create Threads</b> button is pressed, the <b>count</b> method is 
dispatched on a new thread. It then creates a new <b>Counter</b> object and 
adds it to the <b>counters</b> list (which causes the <b>Counter</b> to appear
in the user interface. It then counts by incrementing the <b>Counter</b>
object's <b>count</b> trait (which again causes a user interface update each
time the counter is incremented). After it reaches its maximum count, it
removes the <b>Counter</b> from the <b>counter</b> list (causing the counter
to be removed from the user interface) and exits (terminating the thread).

Note that repeated clicking of the <b>Create Thread</b> button will create 
additional threads.
